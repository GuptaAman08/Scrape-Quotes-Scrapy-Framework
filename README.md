# Scrapy_Framework
In this repository, I have created a scrapy project, to extract quotes from a quotes.com website and stored it in both sqliteDB and MongoDB Database.

###### Defined the fields/Items to be fetched from pages scraped in items.py file (More of like field definition in DJango Projects)

###### Used item pipeline components concept to create two itempipeline components, one for storing scraped data in sqliteDB and another component for storing data in MongoDB.
