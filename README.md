# Scrapy_Framework
Over Here, we scrape books from an amazon page that too using two spiders and running those spiders from a pyhon script file. Also. we change config file to download images and save into target folder.

##### Defined the fields/Items to be fetched from pages scraped in items.py file (More of like field definition in DJango Projects)

##### Used item pipeline components concept to create two itempipeline components, one for storing scraped data in sqliteDB and another component for storing data in MongoDB.
